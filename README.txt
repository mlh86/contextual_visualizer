contextual_visualizer -- An app that puts things in perspective

This little app offers spatial and population-based visualizations
to help the user get to grips with his or her place in the universe.

On the spatial side, you enter your house-area, your city's area and
your country-name, and it shows you three levels of perspective:
- how big your city would be if your house was shrunk to 1 pixel
- how big the world & your country would be if your city was shrunk to 1 pixel
- how big earth's orbit is compared to the size of the sun and the earth

On the population side, it shows you the number of people born every hour and
every day, as well as the number of deaths per hour and per day.

You can press Ctrl+S in any of the visualization windows to save that graphic
as a PNG file, for better perusal (zooming in, etc.)

You can mail mlh86.pk@outlook.com if you have any suggestions.
